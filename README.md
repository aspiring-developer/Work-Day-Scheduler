## Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a Javascript and jQuery based app that helps create a daily schedule. Moment time and date object are also used to build it.
- I started this project with designing a sample visual layout with html and css.
- Then taking that design as a reference, I started Javascript coding to create necessary elements and styled them.

### Functionality:

- Simply type your daily work-time schedules by hour and save them.
- This app is already deployed to GitHub Pages. Click the link below to access the app.

# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is a workday scheduler created by using Javascript and jQuery.
- I started this project with designing a sample visual layout with html and css.
- Then taking that design as a reference, I started Javascript coding to create necessary elements and styled them.
- I then worked on further functionality of the app by coding more. 
- The code worked, but there was more than 200 lines of codes that did not make me happy, so with my tutor's help I was able to shortened the codes. The tutor asked me to use loops and functions to do so. By using the tutor, I learned many things necessary for Javascript coding.
- Finally, I am happy with the final result.
