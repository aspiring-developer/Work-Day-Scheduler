## Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a Javascript and jQuery based app that helps create a daily schedule. Moment time and date object are also used to build it.
- I started this project with designing a sample visual layout with html and css.
- Then taking that design as a reference, I started Javascript coding to create necessary elements and styled them.

### Functionality:

- Simply type your daily work-time schedules by hour and save them.
- This app is already deployed to GitHub Pages. Click the link below to access the app.
